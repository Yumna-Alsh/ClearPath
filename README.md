# ♿ Welcome to ClearPath  

**ClearPath** is a map-based web app designed to help wheelchair users discover and share accessible public places like parks, restaurants, and restrooms. Users can submit locations, write accessibility-focused reviews, and favorite places they trust.  

I built this because I have a family member who uses a wheelchair, and every outing requires checking if places are accessible. This app is meant to make that easier for everyone in similar situations.
